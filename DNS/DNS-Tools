## nslookup
    The "name server lookup" tool is used to query name servers to find information about resource records. 
    Let's find where the name server for google.com is:
    pete@icebox:~$ nslookup www.google.com
## dig
    Dig (domain information groper) is a powerful tool for getting information about DNS name servers, 
    it is more flexible than nslookup and great for troubleshooting DNS issues.
