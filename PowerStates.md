## To shutdown your system:

$ sudo shutdown -h now
This will halt the system (power it off), you must also specify a time when you want this to take place. 

You can add a time in minutes that will shutdown the system in that amount of time.

$ sudo shutdown -h +2

This will shutdown your system in two minutes. You can also restart with the shutdown command:

$ sudo shutdown -r now
Or just use the reboot command:

$ sudo reboot
