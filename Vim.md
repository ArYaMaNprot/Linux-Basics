## To search for an expression just type the / key and then your search result while you are in a vim session. 
## Once you hit enter, you can press "n" to go forward or "N" to go backward in your search results.

    The ? search command will search the text file backwards, so in the previous example, the last pretty would come up first.
    Now you may notice, the mouse is nowhere is use here. To navigate a text document in vim, use the following keys:

    h or the left arrow - will move you left one character
    k or the up arrow - will move you up one line
    j or the down arrow - will move you down one line
    l or the right arrow - will move you right one character
